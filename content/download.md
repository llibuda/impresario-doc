# System requirements
To run the binaries offered for download here the following requirements must be met:

* Windows 64bit operating system or Linux 64bit operating system
  
* Multicore processor

* At least 2GB RAM

**Note for Windows**: Impresario was tested on Windows 10 only but should also run on Windows 7, Windows 8, 
and Windows 8.1.

**Note for Linux**: Impresario itself and the macros were built and tested on Ubuntu Mate 18.04 LTS. 
As Linux distributions always differ in the used package versions it might happen 
that you have to install newer package versions on your distribution to get the macros loading properly in Impresario. 
This especially applies to macros based on OpenCV. Impresario itself should run out of the box.

Impresario can also be built as 32bit application. However, only 64bit binaries are offered here.

# Downloads
